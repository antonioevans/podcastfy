*low, echoing piano music fades in* The air hangs heavy in the precinct, thick with cigarette smoke and the weight of unsolved cases.

<DetectiveSarah>
*eyes narrowed at a map pinned to the board*  Another one vanished near Trinity Church. <break time='0.2s'/>  Just like the others.
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*shuffling papers nervously*  You know the stories they tell about that place, right Detective? <break time='0.2s'/>  Bad ground.
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*scoffs, takes a drag from her cigarette*  Spare me the ghost stories, Mike. I need facts. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*clears throat*  Right. But... all the victims, same area, no trace... 
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*turns sharply, eyes locking with Mike's*  Which is why we're going back to Trinity Church tonight. We'll see what secrets the shadows hold.
</DetectiveSarah>
<Maria>
*music becomes more tense*  Later that night, the desolate streets around the church seem to whisper with unspoken truths.
</Maria>
<OfficerMike>
*whispering, visibly uncomfortable*  You really think we'll find something here?  It's giving me the creeps...
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*shines her flashlight into the church window*  Keep your eyes peeled, Mike. And your imagination in check. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<EmmaLawson> 
*steps out from the shadows, her voice smooth as silk*  Looking for something, officers? Or perhaps... someone?
</EmmaLawson>
<DetectiveSarah>
*turns, her hand instinctively reaching for her holster* You'd be Emma Lawson. We have some questions for you.
</DetectiveSarah> 
<EmmaLawson>
*a sly smile plays on her lips*  Always happy to oblige the law. But some questions... are best left unanswered. 
</EmmaLawson> 
<Maria>
*music crescendos* In the heart of the city's darkness, a dangerous game of cat and mouse begins.
