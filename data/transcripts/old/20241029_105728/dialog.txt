</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>

<DetectiveSarah>
*Scoffs*
*neutral* <break time='0.2s'/> Ghost stories won’t solve this case, Mike. We need facts. Hard evidence.

*A knock on the door. Officer Mike brings in a woman, her face half-hidden in the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat.*

<OfficerMike>
*neutral* Detective, this is Emma Lawson. She claims she has information about the missing persons. 
</OfficerMike>
<EmmaLawson>

*A chill settled in the air, the unspoken threat hanging heavy between them. The detective leaned forward, a glint in her eye. This case just got interesting.*
