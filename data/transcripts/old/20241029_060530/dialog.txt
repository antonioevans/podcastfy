*a smoky jazz tune underscores the scene, the faint scent of rain lingers in the air*  The old precinct house felt heavy tonight, weighed down by years of unsolved cases and whispered secrets.

<DetectiveSarah>
*eyes fixed on a map dotted with red pushpins*  Another one vanished. Same M.O., same vicinity as the others. <break time='0.2s'/> That church is like a black hole, swallowing them whole.
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*fidgeting with his cap*  You ever hear those stories, Detective? About that church?  <break time='0.2s'/>  They say...
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*cutting him off, voice sharp*  We deal in facts, Officer, not ghost stories. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*swallowing hard*  Right, Detective. But something doesn't sit right.

*the camera pans to a dimly lit interrogation room, a lone figure sits bathed in the harsh glare of a single bulb*

*lips painted a crimson red, a knowing smirk playing on them* They say the city never sleeps. <break time='0.2s'/>  But some secrets, Detective, are best left undisturbed.

*leaning forward, eyes narrowed*  Maybe you can enlighten us, Miss Lawson. You seem to know a lot about secrets.

<EmmaLawson>
*a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes*  Innocence is a fragile thing, Detective. Easily lost in this city.

*the tension crackles, thick and heavy as the smoke from Detective Sarah's cigarette*  In the city that never sleeps, some nightmares linger long after dawn.
