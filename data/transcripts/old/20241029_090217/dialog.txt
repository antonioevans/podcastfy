*low, smoky tone* The air hung heavy with the scent of rain and regret, another night falling on the concrete labyrinth of New York City.

<DetectiveSarah>
*tapping a faded photograph* They vanished right here. <break time='0.2s'/>  Like ghosts in the fog. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*shivering slightly*  Right by that old church, Detective. You know the stories they tell about that place? <break time='0.2s'/>  Some say it's cursed.
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*scoffs* Cursed by bad luck, maybe. <break time='0.2s'/> Or worse. <break time='0.2s'/> Get me everything we have on anyone who's even breathed near that church in the past year. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*fumbling with his notepad* Right away, Detective. <break time='0.2s'/> But... what if it's something we can't explain? 
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*eyes narrowed*  Explanations are for priests and philosophers, Mike. <break time='0.2s'/> We deal in facts. <break time='0.2s'/> And right now, the only fact is people are disappearing.

<EmmaLawson>
*sitting in a shadowed interrogation room, a sly smile playing on her lips* You're looking for answers in the shadows, Detective. <break time='0.2s'/>  But some secrets... some secrets prefer to stay hidden.
</EmmaLawson>
<DetectiveSarah>
*leaning forward, eyes locked on Emma*  And you seem to know a lot about secrets, Miss Lawson. <break time='0.2s'/>  Maybe it's time you shared some of yours.
</DetectiveSarah>
<EmmaLawson>
*her smile fading*  Everyone in this city has something to hide, Detective. <break time='0.2s'/> Even you. 
</EmmaLawson> 
<Maria>
*voice a chilling whisper* The game of cat and mouse was on, played in the flickering gaslight of a city that never sleeps, where every shadow holds a secret and every corner could hide a sin.
