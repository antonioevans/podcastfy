*whispering, with a sense of foreboding*  The rain hammered the pavement, each drop echoing the growing unease in Detective Sarah's gut. The abandoned church loomed before them, a monolith of shadows and whispers.

<DetectiveSarah> 
*eyes narrowed at the church* Three disappearances, <break time='0.2s'/> all within a three-block radius. <break time='0.2s'/> And every lead brings us back to this cursed building. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike> 
*voice hushed, glancing over his shoulder* You know the stories, Detective. They say people used to… disappear <break time='0.2s'/> even back then. 
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*turning to Mike, a hint of weariness in her voice*  Spare me the ghost stories, Mike. We deal in facts here, not fairytales. 
</DetectiveSarah>
*Emma Lawson steps out of the shadows of the church, her scarlet dress a stark contrast to the grim surroundings.*
<EmmaLawson> 
*voice smooth as silk, eyes like ice*  Looking for something, officers? Or perhaps… *someone*?
</EmmaLawson>
<OfficerMike>
*startled, hand hovering near his holster*  Ms. Lawson. We weren't expecting…
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*eyes fixed on Emma, a silent challenge in their depths* We have a few questions for you down at the station. <break time='0.2s'/>  Questions about the missing persons.
</DetectiveSarah>
<EmmaLawson> 
*a cold smile playing on her lips*  Always happy to help the police, Detective. <break time='0.2s'/> But I’m afraid I haven't seen anything… *unnatural*.
</EmmaLawson>
<Maria>
*voice tight with suspense*  The air crackled with unspoken tension. The detective, the nervous officer, and the enigmatic woman who seemed to exist in the spaces between shadows. One thing was clear: in this city, nothing was ever as it seemed.
