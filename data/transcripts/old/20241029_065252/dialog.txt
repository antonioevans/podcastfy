*a smoky, jazz-infused score underscores the scene*  Another damp night in the city that never sleeps, but for some, the sleep has become eternal.

<DetectiveSarah>
*taps a faded photograph* Found near the church again. <break time='0.2s'/>  Same MO. <break time='0.2s'/> Vanished without a trace.
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*nervously runs a hand through his hair* You ever hear the stories about that place, Detective?  <break time='0.2s'/>  They say…
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*cuts him off with a sharp look* We deal in facts, Officer, not ghost stories.
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*clears his throat* Right. Of course, Detective.
</OfficerMike>
<EmmaLawson>
*leans against the precinct doorjamb, a knowing smirk playing on her lips*  Some stories hold truths the living can’t afford to ignore, Detective.
</EmmaLawson>
<DetectiveSarah>
*eyes narrowing*  You got something to say, Ms. Lawson, you say it. <break time='0.2s'/>  You were seen near that church.
</DetectiveSarah>
<EmmaLawson>
*steps into the light, her expression unreadable*  This city's full of shadows. <break time='0.2s'/> Hard to say who's following who.
</EmmaLawson>
<OfficerMike>
*shuffles his feet*  We just want to ask you a few questions, Ma’am. <break time='0.2s'/>  Routine, you understand.
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*fixes her gaze on Emma* Routine that might shed some light on these disappearances. <break time='0.2s'/> Unless you're afraid of what we might find.
</DetectiveSarah> 
<Maria>
*the music swells, then fades to a low hum* One thing was clear: in this city of whispers, someone was holding the truth hostage. And Detective Sarah wasn't about to let it disappear into the night.
