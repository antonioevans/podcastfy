*A lone streetlight flickers, casting an orange glow on the rain-slicked pavement outside the abandoned church.*

<DetectiveSarah>
*squinting at the building*  Four disappearances. <break time='0.2s'/> All within a three-block radius. <break time='0.2s'/>  And each one last seen near thisâ€¦ this relic. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*shivering slightly*  You know, they say this place is cursed, Detective. <break time='0.2s'/>  People vanishing, strange noises at night...
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*dryly* I'm more concerned with facts, Mike, not ghost stories. <break time='0.2s'/> Did you find anything inside?
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*pulling out his notepad, flipping through damp pages* Just dust and cobwebs, ma'am. <break time='0.2s'/> And this. 
</OfficerMike>
<OfficerMike>
*holds up a small, ornate silver locket, tarnished with age* Found it on the floor, near the altar.
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*taking the locket, examining it closely*  Interesting. <break time='0.2s'/> Run it through the system, see if it's connected to any of our missing persons. 
</DetectiveSarah>
<EmmaLawson>
*stepping out from the shadows of the church entrance, her voice smooth as silk*  Looking for something, Detective? Or should I say, *someone*?
</EmmaLawson>
<DetectiveSarah>
*spinning around, her hand instinctively reaching for her holster*  Who are you? And what are you doing here? 
</DetectiveSarah>
<EmmaLawson>
*a sly smile playing on her lips*  Let's just say, I'm familiar with this place's secrets. <break time='0.2s'/> Secrets some would rather keep buried. 
</EmmaLawson>
<Maria>
*The wind howls, rattling the church's broken stained-glass windows, as Detective Sarah stares down the mysterious woman. The line between truth and deception blurs in the shadows of the abandoned church.*
