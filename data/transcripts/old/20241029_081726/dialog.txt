*a smoky, jazz infused theme plays beneath her words*  The rain hammered the precinct windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Detective Sarah's investigation. Another disappearance. Another victim last seen near Trinity Church.

<DetectiveSarah>
*taps a faded photograph*  John Doe, age 42. Jane Doe, age 28. And now, Michael Lawson, age 36. All vanished. All connected to that damned church.
</DetectiveSarah>
<OfficerMike>
*shuffles nervously* You really think it's haunted, Detective?  <break time='0.2s'/> I mean, the stories... 
</OfficerMike>
<DetectiveSarah>
*fixes him with a sharp look*  Stories are for rookies, Mike. Get me the file on Michael Lawson's wife. Emma Lawson.
</DetectiveSarah>
<Maria>
*a low saxophone note hangs in the air*  Emma Lawson. A woman shrouded in whispers, a specter herself in the city's underbelly.
</Maria>
<EmmaLawson>
*cigarette smoke curling around her face*  My husband?  He had a fondness for late-night walks. Especially near Trinity Church. Said it gave him peace. 
</EmmaLawson>
<DetectiveSarah>
*leans forward, eyes narrowed*  Peace? Or something else, Mrs. Lawson?  A rendezvous, perhaps?
</DetectiveSarah>
<EmmaLawson>
*a flicker of something cold in her eyes*  Detectives and their suspicions. It's almost clich√©, isn't it?
</EmmaLawson>
<OfficerMike>
*clears his throat nervously*  Ma'am, we just want to find your husband. 
</OfficerMike>
<Maria>
*the jazz theme fades to a single, mournful trumpet*  The game had begun. A dance between hunter and hunted, with Trinity Church casting its long, dark shadow over them all.
